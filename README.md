# Readme Generator

## Description

This repo/code has the ability for the user to generate a README.md file. "node 'file name'" would need to be typed in the integrated terminal. User will then be asked for the basics of the README.md file. Such as the "title", "description", a "preview" image or gif of the webpage, and two different "links", one for the User's Github and their Webpage created.
